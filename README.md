# ExtraGon JavaScript FTP Client
Fully-Featured lightweight FTP FOSS client made with my JSFTP library, JavaScript, HTML and CSS.
Uses AceEditor (Optionally Monaco) and PathParseTools (by me, embeded into the JSFTP object.)

Works with only one main file and folder containing 4 files.

Extra features: Direct login with URL, FTP profiles, fully mobile-friendly &amp; compatible, saving sessions, productivity &amp; automation tools, auto icon&amp;mode, and **way** more comming.
